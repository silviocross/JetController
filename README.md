License: GPL‑3.0
JetController is an open‑source hardware and software project designed for RC planes, offering flexible PWM control, high‑power lighting, servo sequencing, and smart LED effects — all built on the ESP32‑C3 platform.
The project includes hardware schematics, PCB layout, Arduino‑based firmware, and 3D‑printable parts (housing, EDF afterburner adapters).
